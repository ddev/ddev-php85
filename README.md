## What is ddev-php85?

This add-on allows DDEV users to experiment with PHP 8.5 while it's in Release Candidate (RC) status. PHP 8.5 is expected to be released in November 2024, and you can track its progress at [PHP 8.5.0 Release](https://www.php.net/index.php#2025-09-25-3).

This add-on provides a separate PHP 8.5 service that can be used alongside the main web service.

Since PHP 8.5 is not yet available from the official deb.sury.org repository, this add-on uses the official PHP Docker images to provide early access to PHP 8.5 features.

**Note:** This is a temporary solution. Once PHP 8.5 becomes stable and is available through official repositories, DDEV will provide native PHP 8.5 support, making this add-on obsolete.

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-php85
ddev restart
```

## Quick Test

To quickly test this add-on, create a new DDEV project and try PHP 8.5:

```bash
# Create a test project
mkdir testphp85 && cd testphp85

# Initialize DDEV project
ddev config --auto

# Install the PHP 8.5 add-on
ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-php85

# Start the project
ddev start

# Test PHP 8.5 is working
ddev php85 --version

# Create a simple PHP file to test web functionality
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > index.php

# Launch in browser to see PHP 8.5 info page
ddev launch
```

## Usage

After installation, you can access PHP 8.5 several ways:

### Using the php85 service directly:

```bash
# Check PHP 8.5 version
ddev exec -s php85 php --version

# Run PHP 8.5 scripts
ddev exec -s php85 php -r "echo 'Hello from PHP 8.5!';"

# Use Composer with PHP 8.5
ddev exec -s php85 composer install

# Access the php85 container directly
ddev ssh -s php85
```

### Using the convenience commands:

This add-on provides  `ddev php85` , `ddev composer85`, and `ddev drush85` commands for easier access:

```bash
# Check PHP 8.5 version (shorthand)
ddev php85 --version

# Run PHP 8.5 scripts (shorthand)
ddev php85 -r "echo 'Hello from PHP 8.5!';"

# Use with any PHP flags or arguments
ddev php85 -i  # Show phpinfo
```

The PHP 8.5 service has the same codebase mounted at `/var/www/html` as the main web container.

## Limitations

This add-on has several important limitations:

- **Release Candidate**: PHP 8.5 is in Release Candidate status and may have bugs or compatibility issues
- **No Xdebug**: The current setup does not include Xdebug support
- **Limited Extensions**: Only includes basic PHP extensions (see `php85-build/Dockerfile` for the full list)
- **No Development Tools**: Some development tools that integrate with DDEV's main web service may not work with the PHP 8.5 service
- **Performance**: Building the custom PHP 8.5 image may take additional time during project startup
- **Stability**: Release Candidate PHP versions may have unexpected behavior
- **PHP Version Setting**: The `php_version` setting in DDEV configuration has no effect when using this add-on, as it provides a separate PHP 8.5 service alongside the main web container
- **Performance Mode**: This add-on sets `performance_mode: none` to avoid conflicts between mutagen (used by the main web container) and bind-mounts (used by the PHP 8.5 container). This may impact file sync performance.
